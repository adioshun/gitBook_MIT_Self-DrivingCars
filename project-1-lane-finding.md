# Lane Finding

## 사전 작업(Pre-work)
- Camera calibration, which would help us undstort the images for obtaining better accuracy.
- Finding projective transform, which will be used to obtain top-view of the road, which makes lane detection much easier.
- Estimating resolution, which would help us transform pixels into meters or feet. To do that, the standardized minimal width of lane of 12 feet (or 3.6576 meters) will be used
