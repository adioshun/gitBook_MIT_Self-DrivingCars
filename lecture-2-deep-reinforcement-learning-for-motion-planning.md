# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning

## 1. 강의 목적 
* DeepTraffic에 대하여 살펴보기

## 2. 머신러닝 종류 
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

## 3. The process of Learning
* Perceptron: Implement a NAND Gate 구현 가능 
 * NAND gate가 정상 동작 한다면 어떤 logical function도 만들수 있으므로 중요 

* Learning is the process of gradually adjusting the __weights__ and Seeing how it has an effect on the rest of the network
